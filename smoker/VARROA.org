Varroa - The Inferior [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/beekeeper][BeeKeeper]] Client

A beekeeper is never in control of their bees, what is going on,
someone please send help.

* Building

Varroa is built in golang, atop the smoker internal backend.

It uses [[https://github.com/mattn/go-gtk][go-gtk]], and therefore fits in with all the rest of your apps!
However, it might be a pain to setup, because go's build system is
subpar.

1. Run ~git submodule update --init~
2. Ensure you have the ~go~ command line tool installed
3. Run ~make v~ in this folder to compile, and ~make vr~ to execute

* Install

Simply copy the binary made in ~make~ from ~./bin~ onto your ~$PATH~.

* Issues

Please report issues on [[https://github.com/RoboJackets/beekeeper][RoboJackets/beekeeper]].

* Documentation

Probably never going to happen.
